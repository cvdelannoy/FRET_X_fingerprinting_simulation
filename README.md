# FRET X fingerprinting simulation
Simulate single-molecule protein fingerprinting using FRET X (FÃ¶rster Resonance Energy Transfer via 
 DNA eXchange), train a classifier on them and evaluate the classifier's performance. Code in this 
 repository can be used to reproduce results described in our paper: "Evaluation of FRET X for Single-Molecule 
Protein Fingerprinting".
